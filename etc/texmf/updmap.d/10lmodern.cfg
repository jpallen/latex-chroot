# This file is part of the set of files used to (indirectly) generate the
# final map files such as psfonts_{t1,pk}.map, {pdftex,dvipdfm}_{,n}dl14.map,
# ps2pk.map, builtin35.map and download35.map under /var/lib/texmf/fonts/map/
# (with psfonts.map being a symbolic link to one of psfonts_{t1,pk}.map,
# pdftex.map a symbolic link to one of pdftex_{,n}dl14.map and dvipdfm.map a
# symbolic link to one of dvipdfm_{,n}dl14.map, the choice depending on your
# updmap configuration, which you can customize by altering the files in
# /etc/texmf/updmap.d/ and running update-updmap).
#
# You should *not* modify the aforementioned final map files under
# /var/lib/texmf/fonts/map/ directly, for they are automatically generated by
# updmap-sys(1). Instead, you should read update-updmap(1), updmap-sys(1) and
# if you actually need to make changes to the aforementioned final map files,
# you should make the changes in /etc/texmf/updmap.d/, use update-updmap to
# regenerate /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg and finally updmap-sys to
# regenerate the final map files.
#
# Reading /etc/texmf/updmap.d/00updmap.cfg can also help understand how all
# this works.

#
# Declare the basic Latin Modern map files for use by the updmap-sys(1)
# machinery.

# This map file can be enabled for compatibility with old DVI files, but the
# better thing to do instead of using this workaround is to rebuild these
# files with new LM fonts so that they use up-to-date font names.
