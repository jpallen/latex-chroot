% auxiliary macros for reading font definitions
% from PLAIN.TEX and LFONTS.TEX files:

% ASSUMPTION:
%
% It's assumed that in the files `plain.tex' and `lfonts.tex'
% the commands `\font' consist of the following components:
%   1. the control sequence \font
%   2. a control sequence (TeX's font identifier)
%   3. the equality sign =
%   4. a (possibly empty) sequence of spaces
%   5. a name of a font consisting of at least two characters

      \n@wpref%
    \else
      \thepr@f%
    \fi
    }%

% The command \f@@nt substitutes \font in the LaTeX macro \@getfont
% used for loading font on demand.

\def\f@@nt
    #1% a control sequence name
    % We assume that the macro \@getfont is used in such a way
    % that the fourth parameter to this macro is either
    %   1. a name of a font consisting of at least two characters or
    %   2. a sequence of tokens expanding to a name of a font
    %      such that the first token expands to at least two
    %      first characters of this name.
    % This assumption is satisfied by all standard versions
    % of the LFONTS.TEX file.
    %
    % The token following `\f@@nt#1' is either the first letter
    % of the font name (usually the letter `c' of the `cm...' name)
    % or it is an abbreviation of a font name  (a macro)
    % expanding at the first level to a multicharacter name
    % (e.g., `\@mbi' expanding to `cmmib10').

%   2. with \prefixing turned off (\nonprefixing):    Ü  ç  ë  ...

% definitions of codes in the font layout in the Polish fonts:
% (the hexadecimal digits may be upper or lowercase)

% Each of the following \d@finelayout commands
% includes the definition of a \f@nt<layout> command,
% where <layout> is a font layout name like `pl' `mazovia' etc.

% The \f@nt<layout> command results in executing several times
% a command of the form:      \@Pl <letter> <code>
% and a command of the form:  \@qq <char><char> <code>
%
% There are two meanings of the \@Pl and \@qq commands:
% the primary meanings and the secondary meanings.
%
% The primary meanings of the commands \@Pl and \@qq
% change the `state' of MeX, in the following way:
%
% command of the form: \@Pl <letter> <code>
% (take \@Pl a a1 as an example, i.e., <letter>=a <code>=a1)
%   - define the character of the code a1 as a `letter'
%   - define the control sequence /a as a macro expanding to the
%     letter of the code a1
%   - define the control sequence /aa as a macro expanding to the
%     two-character uppercase hexadecimal code of the corresponding
%     letter, in this case to A1
%
% command of the form: \@qq <char><char> <code>
% (take \@qq ,, ff as an example, i.e., <char>=, <code>=ff)
%   - define the control sequence /,, as a macro expanding to the
%     two-character uppercase hexadecimal code of the corresponding
%     quotation mark, in this case to FF

% The secondary meanings of the commands \@Pl and \@qq are the following:

% command of the form: \@Pl <letter> <code>
% (take \@Pl a a1 as an example, i.e., <letter>=a <code>=a1)
%   - define the character of the code a1 as an active character
%   - define this active character as a macro expanding to the
%     polish diacritical letter corresponding to a, in the current
%     font layout)
%
% command of the form: \@qq <char><char> <code>
%   - do nothing

% the default meaning is primary
% it is redefined for a moment by the macro \layout

\let\@Pl\prim@Pl
\let\@qq\prim@qq

% (The \f@nt... commands are used by the layout switching commands
% -- see the MEX2.TEX file)

% The PL font layout:
% (The codes of the Polish letters in the PL font layout
% equal to the corresponding codes of the Polish letters
