\message{MeX configuration,}

% The following lines define which hyphenation patterns
% are to be included in the current configuration of the MeX format.
% We assume that fonts with different positions of Polish diacritical
% characters can be used within the same document and each font layout
% requires its own hyphenation patterns.
% The standard positions of Polish diacritical characters in TeX's fonts
% is the layout accepted at the 5th European TeX Conference in Cork (1990);
% this layout is called here `PL'.
%
% The standard configuration of the MeX format includes the hyphenation
% patterns for:
%   - the English language (OK for all fonts),
%   - the Polish language used with the fonts in the `PL' layout.
% In such configuration switching to another font layout disables
% hyphenation for the Polish language.
%
% However, the hyphenation patterns for other layouts of fonts including
% Polish diacritical letters are prepared and if memory space in the
% particular instalation of TeX permits the user is free to use INITEX
% to generate a new MeX or LaMeX format containing these patterns.
% Just `unpercent' some of the following lines.

\hyph@nate{english}
\hyph@nate{pl}

%\hyph@nate{mazovia}
%\hyph@nate{latintwo}
