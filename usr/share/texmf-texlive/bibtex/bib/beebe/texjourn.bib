                 devoted specifically to various aspects of reliable
                 numerical computations based on the interval approach.
                 It is managed by an international editorial board from
                 Bulgaria, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United
                 States, and printed in Russia. The journal includes
                 various items in the fields of theoretical research,
                 computer tools, applications, interdisciplinary
                 research and other relevant areas.

                 The IC has been prepared with {\TeX} since 1992.
                 Recently a new style has been designed based on
                 standard {\LaTeX} {\tt article} style with changes in
                 fonts, headings layout, running heads etc. It uses
                 10.8pt Baskerville for body text (the unusual font size
                 is selected for better wedding with CM math) and
                 horizontally-squeezed Palatino for headings. For
                 mathematical formulae, standard Computer Modern is
                 preserved. Proofs are made using em{\TeX} DVIHPLJ on a
                 Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIIp, and final pages are
                 printed at 600dpi. Using V{\TeX} is now under
                 consideration.

                 Papers are accepted in any {\TeX} variety; {\LaTeX}

                 mathematics journal being launched by the University at
                 Albany, State University of New York.\par

                 The journal is broadly based in subject matter,
                 covering algebra, modern analysis, and
                 geometry/topology.\par

                 The papers will be presented via the \TeX{}
                 mathematical typesetting language, developed by Donald
                 Knuth. \TeX{} has become the standard for computer
                 typesetting of mathematical publications.\par

                 Access will be provided through a variety of electronic
                 means, including \path|listserv|, anonymous \path|ftp|
                 and \path|gopher|. In particular, access will be much
                 more convenient than that provided by a conventional
                 print journal. Because papers will be published as they
                 are accepted by the editorial board, publication delays
                 will be minimal.\par

                 The articles will be archived, date stamped, and
                 maintained by the University at Albany, State
                 University of New York. The University takes
                 responsibility for insuring the integrity of the
                 journal's archive in perpetuity.\par

                 The journal will have an ISSN number and will be
                 accessed by the major bibliographic publications in the
                 field.\par

                 The development of this journal is being underwritten
                 by the Office of Information Systems of the University
                 at Albany, State University of New York.\par

                 The New York Journal will be accessible by a
                 combination of \path|listserv| and \path|gopher|\slash
                 \path|ftp|.\par

                 By \path|listserv|, we will distribute abstracts of the
                 papers, together with instructions for retrieving them
                 via \path|ftp| and \path|gopher|.\par

                 The abstracts will be available on four separate
                 \path|listserv| lists: one will distribute abstracts
                 for every paper. The other three are specialty lists,
                 giving abstracts for papers in algebra, analysis and
                 geometry\slash topology, respectively. The reader may,
                 of course, subscribe to any combination of these
                 lists.",

                 unchanged from the official date of publication, as may

                 Printer: Digicopy, Corp., 858 Phoenix Dr., Ann Arbor,
                 MI 48108.

                 Frequency: Twice yearly, issued on astronomical
                 solstices (late June and late December). An effort is
                 made to have the transmission carry the time and date

                 (sort like a first day cover marking for a stamp
                 collector).

                 The ISSN number was assigned by the Library of Congress
                 beginning with the winter issue, 1991.",

                 follows. {\em Solstice\/} is also available in hard
                 copy (\$15.95) a year for those wishing it. The book
                 containing the full year's issues is given an ISBN. The
                 first number in the list is the number for the 1990
                 volume. The third number is the number for the 1991
                 volume. In addition, in the summer, single issues are
                 available. The second ISBN is the number for the single
                 summer 1991 issue.

                 Electronic files can be compared to the hard copy in a
                 library should a reader question whether or not a
                 document has been altered.

                 mathematics have a history of mutual research
                 stimulation (Konigsberg bridge problem, four color
                 problem, \ldots), material from one discipline can shed
                 light on the other. Astronomical solstices are extreme
                 positions at which time northern and southern
                 hemispheres receive maximum and minimum daylight or
                 night. Between the solstices there is varying dominance
                 of day and night; so too, there is varying dominance of
                 mathematical and geographical interaction in articles
                 in Solstice. Of course, the extreme of a purely
                 geographical or a purely mathematical article is also
                 suitable for submission.

                 ``Lecture Notes in Physics''--(Walter Welford's {\em
                 Useful Optics\/}--quite suitable, I think!). Generally,

                 mainframe and printing it out on their Xerox 9700

                 hard copy right after a periodic maintenance of the
                 machines. Then photos are inserted (pasted
                 electronically) onto this hardcopy using a Xerox
                 DocuTech with its high resolution scanner.",

                 temporarily at least, on one of the three 280 meg hard
                 drives in the DocuTech. We await the day when the files
                 can be downloaded from DocuTech hard drive onto a
                 floppy! What would be great of course is if Xerox would
                 make it so that a TeX file on a floppy could be
                 directly fed into the DocuTech--by-passing the

  note-8 =       "7. Copies of {\em Solstice\/} have been sent to {\em
                 Math. Reviews}. A letter was sent to the AMS, following
                 their statement in the September 1991 {\em Notices\/}
                 that there was no peer-reviewed online journal of
                 mathematics, informing them of {\em Solstice\/}'s
                 existence. There appears to be a great deal of
                 difficulty in archiving this sort of publication. The
                 earliest one I have found is Richard Zander's {\em
                 Flora Online\/}--he is Curator of Botany and the
                 Buffalo Museum of Science--this journal dates from
                 1987. It is not a TeX-ed journal; it is peer-reviewed.
                 No doubt, though, you are aware of Michael
                 Strangelove's directory of electronic journals--think
                 he lists a subset that are TeX-ed. He's at the
                 University of Ottawa in the Department of Religious
                 Studies, I believe.",

                 of document production; when hard copy is produced (to
                 suit demand--``just-in-time'' publishing) it is printed
                 on 100\% recycled paper with a large percentage of
                 fiber from post-consumer (20\% to 40\%, depending on
                 the lot) products. Obviously, the electronic
                 distribution of {\em Solstice}, free, across Bitnet and
                 Internet, is cheap and environmentally sensitive.
