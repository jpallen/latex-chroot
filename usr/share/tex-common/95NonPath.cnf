%  Part 3: Array and other sizes for TeX (and Metafont and MetaPost).
% 
% If you want to change some of these sizes only for a certain TeX
% variant, the usual dot notation works, e.g.,
% main_memory.hugetex = 20000000
% 
% If a change here appears to be ignored, try redumping the format file
% with fmtutil-sys.

% Memory. Must be less than 8,000,000 total.
% 
% main_memory is relevant only to initex, extra_mem_* only to non-ini.
% Thus, have to redump the .fmt file after changing main_memory; to add
% to existing fmt files, increase extra_mem_*.  (To get an idea of how
% much, try \tracingstats=2 in your TeX source file;
% web2c/tests/memtest.tex might also be interesting.)
% 
% To increase space for boxes (as might be needed by, e.g., PiCTeX),
% increase extra_mem_bot.
% 
% For some xy-pic samples, you may need as much as 700000 words of memory.
% For the vast majority of documents, 60000 or less will do.
% 
main_memory = 1500000 % words of inimemory available; also applies to inimf&mp
extra_mem_top = 0     % extra high memory for chars, tokens, etc.
extra_mem_bot = 0     % extra low memory for boxes, glue, breakpoints, etc.

% ConTeXt needs lots of memory.

% Lambda too is a memory hog with all languages installed
main_memory.lambda = 2200000

% Extra space for the hash table of control sequences (which allows 10K
% names as distributed).
hash_extra = 50000

% Max number of characters in all strings, including all error messages,
% help texts, font names, control sequences.  These values apply to TeX and MP.
pool_size = 1250000
% Minimum pool space after TeX/MP's own strings; must be at least
% 25000 less than pool_size, but doesn't need to be nearly that large.
string_vacancies = 90000
% Maximum number of strings.
max_strings = 100000
% min pool space left after loading .fmt
pool_free = 47500

% Buffer size.  TeX uses the buffer to contain input lines, but macro
% expansion works by writing material into the buffer and reparsing the
% line.  As a consequence, certain constructs require the buffer to be
% very large, even though most documents can be handled with a small value.
buf_size = 200000

% Hyphenation trie.  The maximum possible is 4194303 (ssup_trie_size in
% the sources), but we don't need that much.  The value here suffices
% for all known free hyphenation patterns to be loaded simultaneously
% (as TeX Live does).

dvi_buf_size = 16384 % TeX
gf_buf_size = 16384  % MF

% It's probably inadvisable to change these. At any rate, we must have:
% 45 < error_line      < 255;

% 60 <= max_print_line;
% These apply to Metafont and MetaPost as well.
